What is a silent auction?

A silent auction is an event at which items for sale are displayed for attendees to assess, place bids on, and purchase. However, unlike most auctions, there is no auctioneer present, and participants place their bids silently and anonymously on a bid sheet using a bidding numberâ€”hence the name silent auction.

###  To give an example of the blind auction program  ###

Let's say I will be the first to enter the program. I will give my name and offer. Let's say I'm bidding $42 for this product.
After I finished my bid, he asked me if there were any other bidders.
So if I type yes, the screen is cleared and I can pass the laptop over to the next person to bid. Let's say there is Halil who will bid less than I do. And then it will lead to the last bidder who will bid $ 95.
Now at this stage, if everybody's done, then we'll write no and
This will now calculate all bids and determine who will make the highest bid and give us a winner, and 'Winner is Ahmet.
With an offer of $ 95.
